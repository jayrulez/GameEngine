"""effects.py: the board's marks in the snow, written through the editor's MCP.

- Effects/Track.png (generated: no third-party content): one stretch of the board's track, a soft
  groove a board wide, its ends tapered so the next mark's overlap joins it.
- Prefabs/TrackMark: the track's mark, as the board drops them behind it (Board.as spawns one every
  `trackSpacing` metres and turns it to the heading): an unrotated root carrying TrackMark.as (it
  fades the mark and removes it) and a child decal pitched to project down onto the snow (a decal
  projects along its local +Z).
