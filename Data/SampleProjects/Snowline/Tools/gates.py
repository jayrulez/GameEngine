"""gates.py: the slalom gates' and the finish's prefabs, written through the editor's MCP.

Needs the Blender props imported first (blender/props.py into generated/Props, then importall.py):
GatePole, GateFlagRed, GateFlagBlue and Finish, each a model with its prefab.

- Prefabs/GateRed, Prefabs/GateBlue: two poles HALF_WIDTH either side of the gate's origin (visual
  only: a rider brushing a pole is not stopped dead) and a flag on each, 1.55 m up, out from the
  gate. Each flag is a light dynamic body on a hinge about up anchored in the world (no pole body:
  the joint's target is nil), limited to about 75 degrees either way: gravity does not swing it,
  and its damping takes a swing out. The flags are in collision group FLAG_GROUP, which the scene
  keeps from colliding with anything (course.py): a flag pinned at its limit is a wall, and a rider
  riding into one stopped dead. Gate.as swings a flag the rider brushes past instead.
- Prefabs/FinishLine: the finish arch.

The scene places them (course.py): a gate is an entity with Gate.as and one of these under it.
