"""course.py <course>: a course's scene, written through the editor's MCP (scene_write).

Needs terrain.py <course> and importall.py <course> first: it places what they made. The scene:
- the sun;
- the mountain: the terrain, its heightfield as a static body, and the vegetation (pines on the
  forest floor's splat layer, rocks scattered thinly on open snow);
- the course line: a spline down the middle of the course (terrain.py's points, with Catmull-Rom
  handles, stored as written);
- the rider (Board.as on a character, the modelled rider and board under it) at the top gate;
- the slalom gates (Gate.as on each, the course's red and blue prefabs in turn under them) every
  gate_spacing metres down the course (RULES), swinging side to side of the line, standing on the
  snow (terrain.py's mountain), none on a shortcut's bend; and the finish (Finish.as,
  Prefabs/FinishLine) at the line's end;
- the gems (Gem.as on each, the Gem model under it): a row of GEM_ROW between each pair of gates,
  gem_offset metres out on the side of the gate before them, past the packed course, so taking
  them means holding a wider line than the gates ask for; and a row down a shortcut;
- the medal ghosts (Ghost.as, a path_follow on the course line, the rider model under it in a
  medal's see-through colour, ghosts.py's materials): one per medal, each riding to the finish at
  its medal's time;
- the player's ghost (PlayerGhost.as, the rider model under it in ghosts.py's GhostPlayer): the
  course's best run, saved, ridden again beside the player; hidden until there is one;
- the kickers (Kicker.as, which sets the launch off the lip, on Models/Props/KickerModel with its
  collision) on the course line between gates;
- the chase camera (FollowCamera.as).
