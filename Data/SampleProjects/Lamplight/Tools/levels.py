"""levels.py: Lamplight's levels as tables, which level.py writes as scenes.

Ground and walls in grid cells (a cell is 2 m; cell (i, j) spans x 2i..2i+2, z 2j..2j+2; a wall run
goes along grid lines from point to point); everything placed in the world in metres. North is -Z,
and the thief starts facing it with the camera south of him.

- ground: (kind, (i0, j0, i1, j1)) rectangles of tiles (Floor, Grass, Gravel, Flags), later ones
  over earlier ones.
- walls: (kind, (i0, j0), (i1, j1)) runs (Wall, Hedge, GardenWall, CellarWall), with a corner piece at each end;
  corners: (kind, (i, j)) more corner pieces (either side of a gate, where a run meets another
  mid-way).
- openings: {"at": (i, j) the segment's middle, "kind": Doorway / Gate / Gap, "locked": bool}.
- lamps: {"kind": LanternPost / OilLamp, "at": (x, z)}.
- guards: a round per guard, its points (x, z) walked in turn.
- loot: {"kind": Purse / Candlestick, "at": (x, z), "value"}; target: the one thing the level is
  for, carried to the exit (a trigger, (x0, z0, x1, z1)); checkpoints: trigger rectangles.
- props: {"kind": HayBale / Trough / Barrel / WineRack, "at": (x, z), "yaw": degrees}: cover, each with its collider.
- rooms: {"name", "rect": (i0, j0, i1, j1) cells, "roomSize", "damping", "wet"}: a reflection probe
  over the room and a reverb zone round it. hatch: (x, z) of a cellar hatch (put the exit over it).
- lamps also: {"kind": OilLamp / Candelabra, "at", "intensity"}: a table with that lamp on it;
  {"kind": Torch, "at"}: a torch on its stand, flickering.
- stairs: (x, z) of the foot of stairs rising north out of the level (put the exit there).
- start: the thief's (x, z, yaw degrees); bounds: the navigation zone's (x0, z0, x1, z1).
- moon: its intensity and direction (0: none); rain: true for rain round the thief and its sound;
  environment: Night (the default) or Cellars (look.py).
