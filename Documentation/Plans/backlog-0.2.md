## Seeded: mountable content directories (user 2026-08-29)

Origin: reviewing Sedulous's VFS while building the editor's `data://` discovery+mount. Sedulous lets
a project MOUNT MULTIPLE content directories. The ask: allow an editor project to mount additional
content dirs beyond its own Sources/ - so authored content can be packaged (zip a data dir), shipped
to someone else, and they DOWNLOAD + MOUNT it into their editor project (asset packs, shared prefabs,
sample content). Builds on foundation.vfs (schemes/mounts) + the content DB.

Sketch: a project references N mounted content roots (its own + external packs); the content DB and
asset browser union them; GUID stability across packs (a pack's assets keep their guids so references
resolve after mounting). Decide: mount persistence (in project settings), conflict handling (same
guid in two packs), whether external mounts are read-only, and product/cook handling for mounted
sources. Relates to the `data://` discovery work + [[vfs-and-resource-stack]].
